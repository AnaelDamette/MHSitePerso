        My name is <strong>Marina</strong>, I am a native French translator
        based in Mons, Belgium. I translate from
        <strong>English, Spanish, and Romanian</strong> into
        <strong>French</strong>. I specialise in
        <strong>international development</strong> and
        <strong>arts</strong> (espacially music and dance) Concerning my
        qualifications, I have an MA in Translation Studies from the University
        of Mons. . I have chosen translation as my profession, but I have many
        other passions that enrich my cultural and linguistic skills ; I am a
        <strong>musician</strong> (12 years of harp, choir and music theory), a
        <strong>dancer</strong> (I have been dancing Salsa and Bachata since
        2016 and teaching since 2020), and as an
        <strong>amateur</strong> artist, I enjoy everything about visual arts
        (photography, drawing, etc.) My main goal ? Giving you a voice to
        communicate and share your ideas with the French speaking audience !
